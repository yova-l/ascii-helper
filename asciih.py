        **** Welcome! You have called the program without any parameters and 
        that's why you are seeing this. Remember that you can use the program 
        one command after another or concatenate multiple valid commands to get 
        an specific character if you remember the corresponding combination ****
              
        This program will copy to your system clipboard the character that 
        you want so you don't have to google it or enter weird combinations
        anymore.
